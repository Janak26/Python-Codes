Quartiles:
Given an array,X, of n integers, calculate the respective first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3).

The first line contains an integer,n, denoting the number of elements in the array. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

Sample Input:
9
3 7 8 5 12 14 21 13 18

Sample Output:
6
12
16



Interquartile Range:
The interquartile range of an array is the difference between its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e. Q3-Q1).
Given an array, X , of n integers and an array, F , representing the respective frequencies of X's elements, construct a data set,
S, where each xi occurs at frequency fi.

The first line contains an integer, n , denoting the number of elements in arrays X and F. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array X. 
The third line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array F.

Sample Input:
6
6 12 8 10 20 16
5 4 3 2 1 5

Sample Output:
9.0
